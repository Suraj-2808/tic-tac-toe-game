The game is played on a 3x3 grid, with players taking turns to place their X or O in a cell. The first player to get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.

The game interface is simple and user-friendly, with clear instructions on how to play. Players can restart the game at any time by clicking the "Restart" button.
